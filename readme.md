# Personal portfolio website
Hello I'm Chelly! Thanks for checking out the repo of my portfolio website. I think I've grown as developer in the past year, so I wanted to create something to showcase some of my work online. In this website I recreated certain functionalities and applications I have worked on during past projects. It isn't just my first portfolio website, but also a personal project where I can apply everything I've learned so far.

## What I used
- NextJS
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
